# IVR CALL METRICS MODEL ENHANCEMENT

In this project, I worked with 21,674 unique IVR call records and 293,349 related steps and modules 
in BigQuery to optimize and enhance the data model. Using advanced SQL techniques, I integrated multiple datasets, 
calculated key metrics, and improved data accuracy, resulting in a consolidated IVR summary table 
for more efficient reporting and analysis.

✅Optimized the data model for 21,674 IVR call records and 293,349 related steps, improving query performance 
and data retrieval efficiency.

✅Developed advanced SQL queries using CTEs, JOINs, and window functions to track repeated customer 
interactions, enhancing reporting accuracy.

✅Automated the calculation of key call metricssuch as call durations, customer identification, 
and 24-hour repeated calls, improving operational insights.

✅Implemented data cleaning logic to handle nulls and unknown values, increasing data integrity and reducing reporting errors.

✅Consolidated all results into a single, comprehensive IVR summary table, streamlining reporting and enabling 
faster analysis of customer call behavior.
