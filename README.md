ðŸ’»# IVR CALL METRICS MODEL ENHANCEMENT

In this project, <p><b>I worked with 21,674 unique IVR call records and 293,349 related steps and modules 
in BigQuery</p> to optimize and enhance the data model. Using advanced SQL techniques, I integrated multiple datasets, 
calculated key metrics, and improved data accuracy, resulting in a consolidated IVR summary table 
for more efficient reporting and analysis.

âœ…Optimized the data model for 21,674 IVR call records and 293,349 related steps, improving query performance 
and data retrieval efficiency.

âœ…Developed advanced SQL queries using CTEs, JOINs, and window functions to track repeated customer 
interactions, enhancing reporting accuracy.

âœ…Automated the calculation of key call metricssuch as call durations, customer identification, 
and 24-hour repeated calls, improving operational insights.

âœ…Implemented data cleaning logic to handle nulls and unknown values, increasing data integrity and reducing reporting errors.

âœ…Consolidated all results into a single, comprehensive IVR summary table, streamlining reporting and enabling 
faster analysis of customer call behavior.
