ðŸ’»# </b>IVR CALL METRICS MODEL ENHANCEMENT</b>

In this project, <b>I worked with 21,674 unique IVR call records and 293,349 related steps and modules 
in BigQuery</b> to optimize and enhance the data model. Using advanced SQL techniques, I integrated multiple datasets, 
calculated key metrics, and improved data accuracy, resulting in a consolidated IVR summary table 
for more efficient reporting and analysis.

âœ…<b>Optimized the data model for 21,674 IVR call records and 293,349 related steps</b>, improving query performance 
and data retrieval efficiency.

âœ…<b>Developed advanced SQL queries using CTEs, JOINs, and window functions</b> to track repeated customer 
interactions, enhancing reporting accuracy.

âœ…<b>Automated the calculation of key call metrics</b> such as call durations, customer identification, 
and 24-hour repeated calls, improving operational insights.

âœ…<b>Implemented data cleaning logic to handle nulls and unknown values</b>, increasing data integrity and reducing reporting errors.

âœ…<b>Consolidated all results into a single, comprehensive IVR summary table</b>, streamlining reporting and enabling 
faster analysis of customer call behavior.
